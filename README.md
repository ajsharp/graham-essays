_This is a fork of [ofou/graham-essays](https://github.com/ofou/graham-essays). All credit is due to ofou for making for making PG's essays available as local markdown files._

I used this fork to print a custom book of a selection of PG's essays. All I did was collect the essays I wanted in `essay-list.txt`.

## How to use this to print your own PG essay book

1. Run `make download` to install the dependencies and download all the essays
1. List the essays you want to output in `essay-list.txt`
1. Run `make pdf2`. This builds the epub file and converts it to PDF using a different style than the original `make pdf` command.
1. Create an account at lulu.com, upload the pdf, and order a print. It cost me about $30 with shipping ðŸ˜Š.

**Check out the [releases page] for the latest build, updated daily.**

Download the _complete collection_ of +200[list] essays from [Paul Graham] website and export them in [EPUB], and Markdown for easy [AFK] reading. It turned out to be a whooping +500k words. I used the RSS originally made by [Aaron Swartz] [shared] by PG himself, `feedparser`, `html2text`, `htmldate` and `Unidecode` libraries for data cleaning and acquisition.

## Dependencies for MacOS

On macOS you need [brew] in order to install the dependencies listed in the Makefile.

## Usage

Run the [Makefile](./Makefile) in the root directory using:

```bash
make
```

### Current Essays

Here's a [list] of the current essays included, and an [EPUB].
